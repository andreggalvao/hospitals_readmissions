 How can hospitals reduce readmissions?

## Background
You work for a consulting company helping a hospital group better understand patient readmissions. The hospital gave you access to ten years of information on patients readmitted to the hospital after being discharged. The doctors want you to assess if initial diagnoses, number of procedures, or other variables could help them understand the probability of readmission. They want to focus follow-up calls and attention on those patients with a higher probability of readmission.

## Your challenge
Create a report that covers the following:

1. What is the most common primary diagnosis by age group?
2. Some doctors believe diabetes might play a central role in readmission. Explore the effect of a diabetes diagnosis on readmission rates.
3. On what groups of patients should the hospital focus their follow-up efforts to better monitor patients with a high probability of readmission?

In this project, we performed a thorough analysis of each reported resource, with the aim of answering some critical questions related to the hospital's performance. Based on the results of the analysis, we established a new indicator that allows physicians and the hospital to continuously monitor pacients performance and identify areas that need improvement. The implementation of this new indicator will also help to improve the quality of services provided by the hospital and, consequently, reduce patient recurrence. In short, our project aimed to improve the hospital's efficiency and effectiveness by identifying and monitoring critical performance indicators.
